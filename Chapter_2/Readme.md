-  i made server using express
- there are two types of endpoints
website endpoints
api endpoints


## Rest Client(Browser or Client Emulator)
- i downloaded Rest Client from extensions
then i create a .rest file
where syntax=
(http verbs) url
eg 
GET http://localhost:8383/dashboard

request are seperated by ###

## crud is nothing but http verbs
CRUD(http method)- create(post) read(get) update(put) delete(delete ) 


## middleware

this are the way to configure request and responses
eg `app.use(express.json())`
